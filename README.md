# Hello this is Abdulmalik and Iyanu's Print F project 
### We plan to achieve the following with this project:

- **Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);***

- **Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)** 

- **Write output to stdout, the standard output stream format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:  ***c s %*****
